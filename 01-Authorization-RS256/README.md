# Symfony Authorization for RS256-Signed Tokens
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/community-driven-brightgreen.svg"/> <br>

This sample demonstrates how to protect endpoints in a Symfony API by verifying an incoming JWT access token signed by Auth0. The token must be signed with the RS256 algorithm and must be verified against your Auth0 JSON Web Key Set.

This repo is supported and maintained by Community Developers, not Auth0. For more information about different support levels check https://auth0.com/docs/support/matrix .

## Getting started

### Installation

#### Install the Dependencies

Run `composer install`.

#### Configure the App with your Auth0 Domain and Audience

Rename `.env.example` file to `.env`. Replace `{AUTH0_DOMAIN}` with your Auth0 domain and `{AUTH0_AUDIENCE}` with the **Identifier** you have set for your API in the Auth0 dashboard.

#### Start the Application

Run `php bin/console server:run 127.0.0.1:3010` to start the server.

The API will be served at [localhost:3010](http://localhost:3010).

#### Running the Sample With Docker

In order to run the example with docker, you need to have `docker` installed.

You also need to set the client credentials as explained [previously](#Configure-the-app-with-your-auth0-domain-and-audience).

Execute in command line `sh exec.sh` to run the Docker in Linux, or `.\exec.ps1` to run the Docker in Windows.
